MyAdwaita - A GTK theme
=======================

My Adwaita appropriation, made with a decent amount of scorn for GNOME's
recent idiocity and yearnful longing for days when running Linux desktop
was still a fun, colorful, customizable, and empowering experience.

The theme is made to work with GNOME/GTK+ stack that comes with (each)
Debian stable.


Installation
------------
Copy all files into ~/.themes/MyAdwaita.

    mkdir ~/.themes
    cd ~/.themes
    git clone https://github.com/kernc/MyAdwaita
